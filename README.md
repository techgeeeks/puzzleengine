# puzzleengine
It's a puzzle solving engine in c++.
In this there is a all in one header file named puzzle.h(main.cpp) which contain generic function for solution of three puzzles.
This contain solution of three puzzles-1.)Frog leap problem in the header file header.h
2.)Wolf goat cabbage river croosing puzzle in wgc.h
3.)Family crossing river puzzle in family.h which I have just printed the solution on console because it is much similar to puzzle 2.
